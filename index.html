      <h3>More about me</h3>
        <p>Whenever it&#39;s your first time meeting someone in college, the typical questions usually come up sometime in the discussion: <q>How old are you? 18</q>, <q>What dorm are you living in? Brumby</q>, <q>What&#39;s your major? Finance</q>.  All seem like easy questions to answer, right?  All are simple for me, except for the dreadful question, <q>Where are you from?</q>.  Being somewhat of a military brat, I did not settle down in one place for my entire life, making this question require a more detailed answer than the usual one-word response.  I grew up in Atlanta, but spent 8 years of my life in Germany, from the age of 9 to 17. What follows is usually that I get asked the same the confused questions, <q>Do you speak German?</q>, <q>Why were you in Germany?</q>, <q>What&#39;s better America or Germany?</q>.  I begin with explaining that I do not speak German (which is actually really sad because I was there for so long).  Then I proceed into basically giving a narrative of my life beginning with my mom working for the United States Department of Defense being the reason for living overseas. I go on to describe how I grew up in Atlanta but spent almost half of my life overseas, which happens to be those critical years which shape who you are.  I could easily say that I am from Atlanta, but I do not believe that is the entire truth.  I do not feel I am a great representation of a true &#39;Atlantian&#39; (someone from Atlanta).</p>

    <h3>Schools I attended</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>West Manor Elementary (Atlanta, GA)</li>
          <li>Deerwood Academy (Atlanta, GA)</li>
          <li>Patrick Henry Elementary (Heidelberg, Germany)</li>
          <li>Ramstein Middle School (Kaiserslautern, Germany)</li>
          <li>Ramstein High School (Kaiserslautern, Germany)</li>
          <li>Riverwood International Charter School (Atlanta, GA)</li>
      </ul>

          <p style="font-size:200%"><em>I have changed schools a lot!</em></p>

    <h3>What my experience overseas has taught me</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>Be embrace diversity</li>
          <li>To see an outsider&#39;s perspective of the USA</li>
          <li>Respect the American military</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>More about me continued...</h3>
        <p>Living overseas in a foreign country forced me to come out of my comfort zone and try new things.  I was submerged into an entirely different culture, and stuck out like a sore thumb being a young black boy in Europe.  But because of all the different people I met, it made the transition much easier as I saw that I was not the only one trying to adjust to a new life.  The military community has families coming in and out of cities every year and is great at getting those families adjusted.<p>
